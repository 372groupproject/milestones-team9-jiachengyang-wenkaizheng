We are going to implement internet proxies based on Shadowsocks protocol, which is an encrypted transmission based on Socks5 proxy.
Its main goal is to enhance users' privacy when they are using the internet and avoid censorship.
We expect the program to have at least four packages: core, client, server, and encryption.
Core will contains useful functions to deal with Socks5 protocol.
Client and server will use the functions in core.
Encryption will have functions for encryption.
The implementation design will be below:
user -> client/local proxy --encrypted--> server proxy -> real server
user <- client/local proxy <--encrypted-- server proxy <- real server
We encrypt the Internet traffic data between our proxies, and data packets we send/receive will be formatted based on Socks5.
Each proxy will listen to the traffic from two sides and keep reading and receiving data.
We expect 500 lines of code.
This project can illustrate the advantage of GO because a proxy needs to deal with considerable amount of data, and Go has the ability to run multiple goroutines as they are very efficient and cheap.
