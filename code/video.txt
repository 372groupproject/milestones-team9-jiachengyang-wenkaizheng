1. We will introduce golang and our project.
2. In the 1st part of our video, we will briefly introduce golang.
Because its syntax is similar to C, which most of us are familiar with,
we are going to focus on some unique features of golang, such as gorountine and interface.
I expect to spend 1-2 minutes for this part.

In the 2nd part of our video, we will talk about our program.
Since it is related to network, which many of our classmates may only have a little knowledge about, I expect to spend one minute to explain it.
After that, I plan to take about 2-3 minutes to show our code and then demo our program.
We will use some network protocol analyzers when demoing our program so that our audience can see what is happening.
We are also planning to show it in real-world usage. For example, we can use it to bypass a firewall.

3. As said above, we are going to mainly use code in our project, but code for each milestone may also be used for explaining the language.
4. As said above, a network protocol analyzer is needed. We are using wireshake right now, but we may switch to another one when demoing our program
For the real-world usage, we are going to test whether our program can bypass the firewall in China,
but I am not confident in it since the firewall has been upgraded for detecting network traffic through shadowsocks protocol.

5. We want to use zoom and slides to shoot it.
