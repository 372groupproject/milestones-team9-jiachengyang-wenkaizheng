We are going to implement internet proxies based on Shadowsocks.
Shadowsocks is an encrypted transmission protocol based on Socks5 proxy. 
Its main function is to enhance the privacy for users when they are using the internet.
The implementation design will be below
user -> client/local proxy -> server proxy -> real server  
user <- client/local proxy <- server proxy <- real server  
We encode and decode the Internet traffic data between our proxies, and data packets we send/receive will be formatted based one Socks5.
Each Proxy will listen to the traffic from two sides, and keep reading and receiving data.
We expect there should be 500 lines of code.
This project can illustrate the advantage of GO because Go is very helpful when the programmer needs to do the Multithreading Programming
